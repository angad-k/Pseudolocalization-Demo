# Pseudolocalization-Demo
A Godot Project to showcase the Pseudolocalization feature that I am implementing for GSoC'21
To test this project before the [PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49361) gets merged, you'll have to clone this [branch](https://github.com/angad-k/godot/tree/pseudolocalization) and build it yourself.
